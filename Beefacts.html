	<h3>The Honey bee</h3>
	<p>1.	The honey bee has been around for millions of years. </p>			
	<p>2.	Honey bees, scientifically also known as Apis mellifera, which mean "honey-carrying bee", are environmentally friendly and are vital as pollinators.</p>
	<p>3.	It is the only insect that produces food eaten by man. </p>
	<p>4.   Honey is the only food that includes all the substances necessary to sustain life, including vitamins, minerals, and water; and it's the only food that contains "pinocembrin", an  associated with improved brain functioning. </p>
	<p>5.	Honey bees have 6 legs, 2 compound eyes made up of thousands of tiny lenses (one on each side of the head), 3 simple eyes on the top of the head, 2 pairs of wings, a nectar pouch, and a stomach. </p>
	<p>6.	Honey bees have 170 odorant receptors, compared with only 62 in fruit flies and 79 in mosquitoes. Their exceptional olfactory abilities include kin recognition signals, social communication within the hive, and odor recognition for finding food. Their sence of smell   is so precise that it could differentiate hundreds of different floral varieties and tell whether a flower carried pollen or nectar from metres away.</p>
	<p>7.	The honey bee's wings stroke incredibly fast, about 200 beats per second, thus making their famous, distinctive buzz. A honey bee can fly for up to six miles, and as fast as 15 miles per hour.</p>
	
	<h3>The bees</h3>
	<p>1.	Male honey bees (drones) have no father, but they do have a grandfather.</p>
	<p>2.   The queen honey bee is about twice the length of a worker.</p>
	<p>3.	A honey bee queen may lay as many as 1000 eggs per day as she establishes her colony.</p>
	<p>4.	Honey bees communicate through pheromones passed on through feeding. This is called ‘trophallaxis’. </p>
	<p>5.	Drones (male honey bees) die after mating. Poor things! Follow this link to learn more about drones.</p>
	<p>6.   Once honey bee eggs hatch into worker larvae, they’ll be fed around 1,300 times per day!</p>
	
	<h3>Honey Production</h3>
	<p>1.	The average worker bee produces about 1/12th teaspoon of honey in her lifetime. Read and you will understand why it makes so much sense to say: "as busy as a bee".</p>
	<p>2.	A hive of bees will fly 90,000 miles, the equivalent of three orbits around the earth to collect 1 kg of honey. </p>
	<p>3.	It takes one ounce of honey to fuel a bee's flight around the world. </p>
	<p>4.	A honey bee visits 50 to 100 flowers during a collection trip.</p>
	<p>5.   The bee's brain is oval in shape and only about the size of a sesame seed, yet it has remarkable capacity to learn and remember things and is able to make complex calculations on distance travelled and foraging efficiency.</p>
	<p>6.	The worker bees produce honeycomb which comprises hexagon shaped cells through the consumption of honey produced from the collected flower nectar. To produce one pound of beeswax, six to eight pounds of honey are ingested </p>
	<P>7.	Honey bees are generally thought not to be 'door step' foragers - in other words, they fly further afield to find food.  They may typically fly between 1 – 6 km on a foraging trip, but also up to 13.5 km.</p>
	
	<h3>Team Work</h3>
	<p>1.   A colony of bees consists of 20,000-60,000 honeybees and one queen. Worker honey bees are female, live for about 6 weeks and do all the work. </p>
	<p>2.	The queen bee can live up to 5 years and it's role is to fill the hive with eggs. She is the busiest in the summer months, when the hive needs to be at its maximum strength, she lays up to 2500 eggs per day. The queen bee has control over whether she lays male or female eggs. If she uses stored sperm to fertilize the egg, the larva that hatches is female. If the egg is left unfertilized, the larva that hatches is male. In other words, female bees inherit genes from their mothers and their fathers while male bees inherit only genes from their mothers.</p> <p>
	<p>3.	Each honey bee colony has a unique odour for members' identification.</p>
	<p>4.   Only worker bees sting, and only if they feel threatened and they die once they sting. Queens have a stinger, but they don't leave the hive to help defend it. It is estimated that 1100 honey bee stings are required to be fatal. </p>	
	<p>5.	Honey bees communicate with one another by dancing. More on their awesome sense of time, communication of distance and direction in "The Awesome Honeybee Dance".</p>
	<p>6.   During winter, honey bees feed on the honey they collected during the warmer months. They form a tight cluster in their hive to keep the queen and themselves warm. </p>
