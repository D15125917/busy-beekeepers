		<h2>Welcome</h2>

	<div class="container">	
	<h3>January</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The bees will consume up to 1 0 Kg of stores in January – so check the hive (don’t open the hive).</li>
		<li>Construct hive parts for the season ahead.<li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>February</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Undertake varroa count and plan treatment as necessary.</li>
		<li>Read and plan the next 6 months, especially Feeding, Swarm Control and Varroa Management.</li>
		<li>Order equipment and bees (from reputable supplier … or a mate), as required.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>March</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Observe hive entrance for flying bees bringing in pollen.</li>
		<li>This is the month when colonies often die of starvation. Weigh hives and feed bees if necessary.</li>
		<li>Remove mouseguards when the weather has warmed up and the bees are no longer in a cosy cluster.</li>
		<li>Start new seasons Hive Record Cards.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>April</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Varroa Management: Either cut off drone brood below shorter frames you are using in the brood box or insert drone brood foundation into the brood chamber next to the outer frame of brood.</li>
	<li>Change brood box and floors for clean ones.</li>
	<li>Inspect every 7-9 days for disease, swarming intentions, status of Queen, brood pattern and stores (9 days is the time it takes the bees to create and cap a Queen cell and decide to swarm). Temperature must be above 15C.</li>
	<li>Practice good apiary hygiene.</li>  
	<li>Use MAQ strips if required for Varroa Management.</li> 
	<li>If bees show intention to swarm then create artificial swarm.</li> 
	<li>Super-up (when bees cover 7 of the 10 frames, add a super).</li> 
	<li>Remove supers for extraction as required – essential if your bees are bringing in oil seed rape.</li> 
	<li>To understand nectar flows, read: Harvesting Honey.</li> 
	<li>Unite weak colonies where necessary.</li> 
	<li>Make sure there is enough space for the bees.</li> 
	<li>This inspection is a good time to find and mark the Queen before hive gets too busy.</li> 
	</ul>
		
	<h3>May</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Start of May – Set up Swarm Traps / Bait Hives.</li>
	<li>Inspect as above.</li>
	<li>Add super, preferably one that needs drawing out.  Thinking: they will produce wax and this might reduce their intention to swarm</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>June</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Inspect as above</li>
	<li>Install Wasp & Hornet Traps (especially if you have the Asian Hornet in your country).</li>
	<li>If have Queen in her 3rd year then create a nuc with her. As I am doing this in mid-June it will not reduce the number of bees available in the Queen-less colony for the July nectar flow. Having a nuc means that if things go wrong you still have the old Queen if the old colony has a problem raising a new Queen. Also – now is a good time to requeen if necessary (e.g. aggressive bees).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>July</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Inspect as above.</li>
	<li>Watch out for robbing.</li>
	<li>This is a good month to requeen (with mated queen).</li>
	<li>Late July or early August (whenever the nectar flow stops):</li>
	<li>Remove supers, harvest honey, put wet supers back on and then remove a few days later when dry (taking honey now, i.e. quite early gives the bees time to create stores for winters and means you might not have to feed them for the winter)</li>
	<li>I put any frames with uncapped honey into one super and put this below the brood box. This gives them a bit of extra food and the extra height keeps them a bit further from the cold ground (I leave it like this till the spring)</li>
	<li>Queen Excluder should be at the top above the brood box</li>
	<li>If medium/high varroa count then add Apiguard – temperatures need to be above 15C for 4 weeks. Varroa counts can be inaccurate – so you might just want to add Apiguard whatever the circumstances</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>August</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Inspect as above.</li>
	<li>Add entrance narrower.</li>
	<li>If required start feeding (Read: Feeding Bees (how-to guide).  Also, read Starving Bees (a post I wrote when my bees had starved by 18th September).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>September</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Inspect and look for:</li>
	<li>Weak colonies.  Colonies need to have bees over at least 5 frames to survive the winter.  Weak colonies need to be either (A) overwintered and fed in a nucleus box or, (B), better to unite weak with strong colonies, as long as they don’t have any disease. I have read only 50% of nucs survive the winter (Read: combining hives).</li>
	<li>String colonies are also queen-right and disease-free.</li>
	<li>Food stores – they need 18Kg of stores to get them through winter. Each standard national brood frame holds 2.5Kg of honey (and each 14×12 holds nearly 3.75Kg). Hence you need 8 (or 6) frames of honey.</li>
	<li>Feed colonies as required (see above), further notes:</li>
	<li>Use thick sugar syrup (2:1 sugar:water).</li>
	<li>1Kg of sugar will create 1.25Kg of stores in the brood box.</li>
	<li>I have queen excluder between the feeder and brood box so the Queen doesn’t get into the syrup and possibly drown.</li>
	<li>Don’t overfeed – you are aiming for spring balance to record a weight of 15Kg each side of the hive (less the roof) by the end of October. Allow for the bees bringing in nectar from ivy.</li>
	<li>Read Feeding Bees for more information.</li>
	<li>Clean equipment prior to storage.  Store and protect brood box, supers and comb from rodents and wax moth (Read: Bee Hygiene). I have started using B401 to protect from wax moth.</li>
	<li>For further information Read Top Tips For Preparing Bees For Winter.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>October</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Keep feeding until spring balance records a weight of 18Kg each side of the hive (less the roof) at the end of October.</li>
	<li>Remove queen excluders.</li>
	<li>Configuration for the winter:</li>
	<li>Adequate ventilation in order to get the moisture out of the hive (bees will get wet and cold otherwise):</li>
	<li>If you have solid floors – then top ventilation required.</li>
	<li>If you have open mesh floor – then no top ventilation required and could cause too much draft.</li>
	<li>Insulated roof (means the warm air rising does not condense and drip down due to a cold roof).</li>
	<li>Put hive at slight angle so drips of condensation on the crown board go down side of hive rather than drip into the winter cluster.</li>
	<li>Add mouseguard – 50% of hives would have a resident mouse if it were not for a mouse guard. Put them on at the end of October (when bees are starting to cluster and not strong enough to defend themselves).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>November</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Take varroa counts.</li>
	<li>Make sure hives are secure against the weather.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>December</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Dead bees might start to block the entrance. Take out the entrance narrower, sweep out the bees with the mouse guard and then replace the entrance narrower but with the entrance at the top, this means that the dead bees should not block the entrance as the entrance is now higher.</li>
	<li>Oxalic acid treatment. In the UK research has shown that 10-25 December is the optimal time to apply Oxalic Acid. </li>
	<li>Feed fondant if required.</li>
	<li>Check stack of stored brood boxes and supers for signs of rodents or wax moth.</li>
	</ul>
